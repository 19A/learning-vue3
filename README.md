## Document

See：[https://vue3.chengpeiquan.com/](https://vue3.chengpeiquan.com/)

## Description

I do not intend to literally translate or copy various official materials, because sooner or later the official websites of each ecology will have a Chinese version, and there is no problem with Google translation now, and there is no need.

I don't intend to summarize the various changes brought about by the version upgrade, because many people have written summary articles.

I mainly **record some problems and solutions in the process of building the project, as well as some bugs how to fix**. Although the official said that it can be smoothly upgraded, there are still many problems found in the coding process, and they continue to be during the process. Continue to type a bunch of notes and code snippets, but scattered, take this opportunity to organize them.

并不打算直译或者照搬官方的各种资料，因为各个生态的官网迟早都会有中文版，何况现在通过Google翻译也问题不大，没什么必要。

也不打算总结版本升级带来的各种变化，因为很多人写了汇总文章了。

我主要是**记录一些在构建项目过程中的问题点和解决方案，以及一些踩坑的地方**，虽然官方说能够平滑升级，但在 coding 的过程中发现问题还是不少，期间陆陆续续打了一堆笔记和代码片段，但零零散散的，借此机会整理起来。
